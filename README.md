# Calc
Calculator showing some logic behind

One of my first attempts on writing JS working beyond good ol' Console environment - originally created in Summer 2020. 
Current version rewritten in TypeScript (with .ts file included for reference); 
HTML updated accordingly - as in span of these few months I learned few things (like, what *not* to do: farewell, inline OnClicks!).
